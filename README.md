This is a branch out of the v215 OneLife repository. Only helper functions and server.cpp is modified with reference to others from OneLife Forum.

Clone the code. Compara the server.cpp with v215 of origin repo to see the how the magic commands work.

Use objectid2codeid.py (py36) to get a .csv table of mapping and start spelling magic.
